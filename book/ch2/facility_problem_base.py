# The objective of the problem is to minimize the sum of facility activation costs and transportation costs.
# The first constraints require that each customerâ€™s demand must be satisfied. The capacity of each facility j
# is limited by the second constraints: if facility j is activated, its capacity restriction is observed; if it is not
# activated, the demand satisfied by j is zero. Third constraints provide variable upper bounds; even though they are
# redundant, they yield a much tighter linear programming relaxation than the equivalent, weaker formulation without
# them, as will be discussed in the next section.
